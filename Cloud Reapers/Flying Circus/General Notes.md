The players have been hired (by TBD) to steal a large amount of ice from Captain Pruina Findor's Glacier Vaults

So, there's a flying fortress where the Arctic Aces keep the ice before it's transferred to the USS Maryland(?). No one knows where the fortress is at any time (except Winchester McFly, the Barometer Bomber).

The Fortress flies around the Arctic Circle at a very high altitude in order to keep the ice frozen.

"No one knows where Frosthaven is. Some say it doesn't exist, but it most certainly does. Some say its glacial vaults contain all the ice in the world, but it most certainly does not. For the last five years, children have been deluged by stories of Arctic Aces delivering blocks of ice in the night to good boys and girls; adults have been drowning in news of towns being forced to pay a deadly ice price to acquire water from them; and leaders and warlords have been sipping the dregs of rumors about Pruina Findor and her Arctic Aces. This crew have been doling out water like its candy, and towns have been giving them money like it was money payed for very important candy.

But a mysterious benefactor has approached two new upstarts and offered a staggering reward. But only if they are able to steal a year's supply of ice from Frosthaven itself, and, most importantly, do so without alerting The Ice Queen herself. Maybe the benefactor needed the hunger that comes from... well, hunger. Maybe he needed strangers who no one knew and no one could identify. Maybe he just needed The Cloud Furies."
