# Frosthaven

Frosthaven is a large flying fortress suspended by four large balloons. It flies around the outskirts of the arctic circle at high altitude.

Frosthaven resembles a large upside down pyramid. It is made of stone and metal in order to shield its inhabitants from the near-constant ice-spear storms that occur in the Arctic Circle. These storms, combined with the ever changing location of the fortress keep it difficult, if not impossible, to access.

For 10 minutes of everyday, a smaller pyramid - suspended by a single balloon and attached by cables to the main fortress - is extended beyond the storms reach. It takes 10 minutes each to extend and retract. The smaller pyramid has no personnel on it.

The balloons that support Frosthaven are powered by melting ice. They retain heat extremely well which not only keeps them aloft but protects them and the fortress top from ice spears.

## Security / Timeline

The platform is extended out. No one is on it. There is a phone box. The platform will only be pulled in halfway until the players get on the phone and convince the Arctic Aces to reel them in.

On level 0, Capo Aiuto is waiting to greet them. He will offer to give them a tour.
Capo is relatively amenable. The only places he won't let the players go is Pruina's or inside the vaults.

Capo will take them to their room first no matter what. Afterwards, he will tell them that Pruina would be delighted to eat dinner with them. He will be back in two hours to take them.

### Unstructured Play Time

Pruina is in the basement. She and Regina Atlas are running experiments on the true ice pyramidion.

**The Story**

"I've been to the north pole before. Reckon I might be the only one in history. I'd tell you how long ago this happened, but I don't know anymore. It doesn't matter anyway. Have you ever spent a whole day staring at the clouds? I mean the entire day. 'Til your lips were as cracked as the clock in your head. You know, the one that tells you where to be when and the amount of time things take and how long ago things were. You come to a strange understanding with the sky; an agreement some would call it. The understanding I came to had shown me a great power that laid at the very heart of the north pole. The agreement I made with the Council of Commanders allowed me to pierce that very heart. They funded my design for a ice spear proof plane made to fly through the arctic clouds, disrupting the process before the spears could be formed. It took more years, lives, and planes than I care to admit. But it worked! My god, it actually worked."

Pruina takes a sip from her wine glass, staring at the legs as they slowly cascade down her glass.

"You can't see anything flying through the clouds. You may as well be flying on a night with no moon with your eyes closed. But there's this hypnosis to the speed of small deviations and pockets flying by you at high speeds. As if the mind, in it's search for a pattern or meaning, overloads itself. And then you crest the clouds and the sun wipes it all away. Seeing the vastness of the ocean of clouds below you must be something like what sailors of old experienced. Surely they had seen a fluke too. But I doubt any of them were ever ripped from the sky by an ten-story, ice-white fluke."

As Pruina seems to experience the memory, she crushes the wine glass in her hand, cursing, "That cursed whale!"

Her hand drips with blood, but without you even having a chance to see him, Capo Aiuto is bandaging her hand. She continues, not even looking at him.

"I managed to pull up in time. My two crewmates, Anathema, and I were saved. At least, we were saved from dying a sudden painless death. Instead, we were to freeze to death in the vast, shattered desert before us. I woke up on the third day, to one of my crewmates standing as far as was still visible from the plane, scarecrow like, impaled by a spear taller than any man. On the seventh night, I heard a cry of pain. The next morning I thought I knew what would await me. Instead I found the remains of a foot, and a trail of blood leading over the hill to the north of us."

Pruina flexes her hand in her bandage, keeping a grimace from her face.

"On the tenth day, I ate my beloved Anathema."

Pruina touches her talon necklace, and is silent for several moments.

- If the players interrupt, she will snap out of her story and thank them for the meal and say her goodbyes.

"I managed to fix the engine after 14 days, and made it far enough through the arctic storm to be picked up and rescued. Ha. Rescue... I have never been that close to powers incomprehensible. I still wonder right now, here, as I talk to you, whether it was worth it."

## Blueprints
### Level 0 - Topside AKA "The Deck"
![[Frosthaven - Level 0.jpg]]

It is constantly lightly raining on the top deck as ice spears are melted and drip from the balloons onto the platform.

Not shown are the massive drains and gutters on the deck of the fortress. Not only are they there to collect water from melted ice-spears, but the Arctic Ace Cloud Reapers often just drop their water straigh onto the deck.

Pipes line almost everything inside the fortress.

The dinghy dock looks like a train station for only a single car, but still big enough for planes to wheel out.

The pill box is made of the same stonelike material the fortress is made from. The doors look like cockpit doors, they lock from the inside. The window is too small to crawl through.

The balloons overhead are absolutely massive. Very little above can be seen around them.

### Level 1 - Living Quarters
![[Frosthaven - Level 1.jpg]]

The first underground level of Frosthaven is still quite large, as big as two and half football fields. The ceilings are several stories up, but not much in here is tall.

The stairs in the corners are small stair case rooms that stop on this floor. The stairs are industrial.

The Crew Quarters are large building like structure at the back of the level. Three entrances, one in the middle and one on either end, lead to a two story hallway. Think college dorm.

The Cafeteria is a small structure to one side of the level. There is a small kitchen in back. The seats are all mismatched and in no order whatsoever. There is a nicer, longer table with a table cloth in the middle.

The Garage is a mostly unmarked open air area to one side of the level. There are three planes in the garage currently: two Arntwerks c.10 and one Markgraf Zerst√∂rer B. There are a dozen incomplete planes or just engines. There's also a handful of random small mechanical projects. One has dust and cobwebs on it. There is a large blast door big enough for a plane on the left wall, and a plane elevator to the right.

The Armory is the bottom floor of a stepped two story building. It has a large garage door in front and a smaller door on the left side. Inside are racks of personal and plane weapons, boxes of ammunition and explosives. You know, armory stuff. There's also a Lost and Found chest, and a locked cage room that houses confiscated equipment from crew members. This room is locked and only squad leaders can access it. It is also guarded 24 hours a day, but there is a shift change at 1800, 0000, and 0600. At the back of the Armory are two locked doors that go down the Vault. Only Pruina and Capo have keys. The shift leader receives a key (that works on Armory and Vault) from Capo everyday. On the right side of the building is a staircase that leads up to Pruina's Room.

Pruina's Room is a private quarters above the armory. Only Pruina has the key to this room, but it is an old fashioned lock. There is a balcony with three megaphones, one underneath the balcony, and two on the corners of the structure. Inside is a two room small personal quarters. The main room features a large table. Before the dinner, the table will have two maps on it one of the arctic charting cloud movements, the ice whale's position, and the fortress' position. The other map is larger and has towns and small figures on it indicating the deliveries and territories of the Arctic Aces. The walls are covered with pictures of Pruina at various ages smiling with people. She stops smiling after more recent ones. On the back wall is tip of a massive see through narwhal horn. It has a strap on it, and a hole at the tip. It appears to be playable.

### Level 2 - The Vaults
![[Frosthaven - Level 2.jpg]]

The stairs from the armory lead to a small metal room. There is an obfuscated glass wall against the back wall. Two large heaters are at either end of the room. A single door leads into the vaults.

The Vaults themselves are a single large bare room. The back half slopes towards a small gap in the wall. The Condensers in each corner look like nothing more than they look like coal engines of old. There is a large pillar at the back of the room. It is the trapdoor which leads up to the living quarters and down to the true ice trap.

### Level 3 - ???

This part of the blueprint is blank. Other than the dimensions of the room. A miniscule 10'x10', this room is barely fit for a prisoner, but may be a panic room, another vault or yes, maybe a brig.

~~In fact, this room is a small lab housing the Pyramidion of True Ice, which is a pyramidion made of True Ice which is near absolute zero. Contact with true ice converts all water to true ice, but nearer to it water just freezes. This energy positive conversion to ice is what powers the fortress.~~

~~A small cage protrudes from the top of the room. It is made of thick, solid, freezing iron. It is meant to freeze those who fall in.~~

~~The Pyramidion is fist sized, but housed in a geodesic ball that is magnetically levitated above the ground for safety.~~
