# The Bering Desert

The Beaufort Desert is the large expanse of uninhabited desert to the North of the USS Maryland. This is where the Cloud Furies will be heading in media res towards.



## Opening Narration

There was a storm brewing on the horizon, but a storm was always brewing. But a storm hadn't boiled over in centuries. One benefit of the apocalypse that no one seems to talk about are the breathtaking sunsets. Even when the clouds block the dazzling iridescence of the sky, like they do today, - and, let's face it, most days - the rays of light the poke through seem brighter and more colorful for the effort. The crisp wind picks up over the dark brown rolling dunes, howling against the small pillars of salt that dot the ground.

The low hum of plane engines. More than one.

## The Fight

Winchester McFly was spotted heading out of town by three Bounty Hunters. The Arctic Aces have a bounty out for him for Thaler sure, but more so a potential spot on the Arctic Aces themselves.

The Bounty Hunters are:

- Woldemar Mathesius AKA "Conquest"
	- Kreuzer Spinne M3
	- ![[Kreuzer-Spinne-M3.png]]
- Heidi Ammermann AKA "Pestilence"
	- Kreuzer Spinne V8 Conversion

- Isolde Niephaus AKA "War"
	- Arntwerks c.7 Rennflugzeug

## Post Fight

No matter what the outcome is, the players should be able to steal the planes of the fallen bounty hunters.

### Winchester Lives

He will take the two to a safe location in the USS Maryland, his local tavern

### Winchester Dies

The blueprints will be recoverable, except for the last page. He will also have an encoded telegram from [[Lance Faulkner]] of when and where to meet with the Cloud Furies.
