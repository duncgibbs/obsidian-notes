# The Arctic Aces

The loveable goofs who follow the ruthless Pruina Findor. Nice enough guys on their own, but have been weedled down to only those who unquestioningly follow The Ice Queen.

## Roles
**Pilots**
Probably between 12-24, but spread out on different duties. Those duties being:
- Seeks
	- These are the pilots who gather water to bring back to Frosthaven. AKA Cloud Reapers.
- Dispatch
	- These are the pilots - in teams of three; one transport and gunner, and one solo fighter - that deliver to towns that pay the ice price.
- Pursuit
	- These are the pilots that patrol the air space around the arctic as well as doing Pruina's dirty work.

**Coasters**
Two to three dozen men at a time live on Frosthaven. They have different duties, but rotate between them on different weeks. Some are pilots just taking a break, while some are permanent landsman.
- Clean
	- These crewmen swab the deck and polish the silverware, so to speak.
- Fix
	- These crew members are the engineers and maintenance men. These make up a majority of the crew members as there is often a need to fix the planes that come in and out, but also Frosthaven itself.
- Power
	- There are only three crewmembers who know how to fix the melting condensers. Pruina Findor is one of them.
- Watch
	- These crew are the all the time guardsmen, but most crew members are willing to fight if it comes to it.
- Dig
	- Usually assigned as punishment, these are the men who shovel ice into the condensers. It doesn't need to be done constantly, but a certain amount must be shoveled each day to maintain Frosthaven's power.
