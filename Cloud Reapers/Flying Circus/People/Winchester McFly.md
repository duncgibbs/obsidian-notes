# Winchester McFly

Winchester McFly is an ex-Barometer Bomber and current [[Arctic Aces]] defector. He made contact with the benefactor about trading secrets for money and protection.

The Cloud Furies _are_ the protection for Winchester. If he is successfully rescued he will answer any questions he can about Frosthaven but is unwilling to go with them. If he is not rescued, the blueprints can still be recovered.

## Plane

Winchester currently flies a Braun Model VJ.
