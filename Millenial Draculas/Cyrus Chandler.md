# Cyrus Chandler

## Memories

- Memory 1
	- I am Cyrus Chandler. I was born in Chicago in 2003. (It's entirely within the realm of possibility that one of the first words my soft, baby brain recognized as "a thing it had heard before" could have been "9/11" or "YouTube.") I am a jazz pianist attending my first year at Berklee in NYC.
- Memory 2
	- My sister Vanessa, walks with me to my piano lessons after a kid pushed me down and tore up my practice books last time.
- Memory 3
	- One night when I was 13, my mom, an engineer at Boeing, gave me the book Programming Pearls and said if I finished the first ten problems she would teach me how to make a synthesizer.
- Memory 4
	- Elle Blivins gives me a Nord Piano 4 for my 16th birthday, apologizing that it isn't a car. I tell her I didn't want a car. We share a kiss.
