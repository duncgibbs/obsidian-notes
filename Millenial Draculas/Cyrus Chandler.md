# Cyrus Chandler

## Memories

- Memory 1
	- I am Cyrus Chandler. I was born in Chicago in 2003. (It's entirely within the realm of possibility that one of the first words my soft, baby brain recognized as "a thing it had heard before" could have been "9/11" or "YouTube.") I am a jazz pianist attending my first year at Berklee in NYC.
- Memory 2
	- My sister Vanessa, walks with me to my piano lessons after a kid pushed me down and tore up my practice books last time.
- Memory 3
	- One night when I was 13, my mom, an engineer at Boeing, gave me the book Programming Pearls and said if I finished the first ten problems she would teach me how to make a synthesizer.
- Memory 4
	- Elle Blivins gives me a Nord Piano 4 for my 16th birthday, apologizing that it isn't a car. I tell her I didn't want a car. We share a kiss.
	- When Elle found out what I was, she didn't hesitate to help me use a friend's account on a blood selling website.
- Memory 5
	- Home for Winter Break, my sister and I get our booster shot of Covid-19 vaccine from our new physician, Dr. Acula. He injects us with a chemical causing vampirism, and a week later, back at college, we begin to turn.
	- My eyesight begins to worsen, and I get glasses that match the handsome and stylish Dr. Acula.

## Prompts

### 1.7.1

_Your body manifests some trait related to the vampire that created you. How do you become more like them? Create a Skill that reflects this._

I guess the worst year in the world isn't the only 2020 in the rear view. I'd been having trouble reading my sheet music all week, so I went to an optometrist (a 24 hour optometrist (bless you, NY) called "Dr. Seegood;" not kidding). Neither of our parents or grandparents needed glasses, and it happened so suddenly. But I need to start wearing glasses. I picked some up that our mom's insurance will cover. Here's the thing though. You're going to laugh at me, and you should. I couldn't think of any Jazz musicians that wore glasses, so I was lost on what style of glasses I should get when I realized who looked good in glasses: Dr. Acula.

### 2.3.1

_A loved one discovers your condition and works to help you. Create a Resource which represents their assistance. Create a mortal character if none are available._

So Elle knows now. I was going to tell her, but she found out before I could. Luckily she believes me that I was going to tell her. It was just... hard. But she actually helped me. I guess one of her friends was doing an art project that required a lot of human blood. (I think given our condition she may want to rethink the term "required".) But anyway, she ended up emailing her and asking where she got it from. It turns out there's a lot of websites selling it. I think it might be for hospitals, but as long as you had a note from your school, the websites didn't mind making some extra cash. Luckily, Elle's friend owed her a favor because she let us use her account with the website. It's not cheap, but it helps. Elle really came through for me. Again.

### 3.5.1

_You murder someone you love or respect rather than let them expose you. Kill a character. Check a skill. If you have no living Characters, kill no one and create a beloved mortal Character who you have betrayed._

I

I didn't mean to kill him.

Emil, the senior saxophone player who invited me to play in his combo, remember? Well he offered it to me again. I was excited. It was at Smoke again. Late at night. After we finished, we chatted and drank. He bought me a drink, which was a nice sentiment at least, since I couldn't have gotten one on my own. He said if his piano player cancelled on him last minute again, he was going to permanently add me! I hadn't drank blood for two nights though. I had a vial in my pocket (this must be what diabetics feel like), so I went out back to drink it. Emil came out for a smoke and saw me down it. At first he thought it was funny. "And I thought you were a straight edge" he laughed, walking towards me. I smiled and didn't notice fast enough when he took it out of my hand.

His face went pale.

Why doesn't the blood packaging come in something more discreet? I panicked. I just did the first thing that came to mind. I pepper sprayed him. I don't know why. But it was already in his face. He fell to the ground and started wheezing. He stopped breathing, his face purple. I ran inside and told the bassist that someone pepper sprayed Emil.

His face was swollen when they took him away in the ambulance. He was asthamtic.
