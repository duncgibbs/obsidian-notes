# Cyrus Chandler

## Memories

- Memory 1
	- I am Cyrus Chandler. I was born in Chicago in 2003. (It's entirely within the realm of possibility that one of the first words my soft, baby brain recognized as "a thing it had heard before" could have been "9/11" or "YouTube.") I am a jazz pianist attending my first year at Berklee in NYC.
	- I kill my friend, Emil Breitenfeld, after he discovers what I am.
- Memory 2
	- My sister Vanessa, walks with me to my piano lessons after a kid pushed me down and tore up my practice books last time.
- Memory 3
	- One night when I was 13, my mom, an engineer at Boeing, gave me the book Programming Pearls and said if I finished the first ten problems she would teach me how to make a synthesizer.
	- I help Acid Ed create glasses that can fool iris scanners after he rescues me from being arrested in New York.
- Memory 4
	- Elle Blivins gives me a Nord Piano 4 for my 16th birthday, apologizing that it isn't a car. I tell her I didn't want a car. We share a kiss.
	- When Elle found out what I was, she didn't hesitate to help me use a friend's account on a blood selling website.
- Memory 5
	- Home for Winter Break, my sister and I get our booster shot of Covid vaccine from our new physician, Dr. Acula He injects us with a chemical causing vampirism and a week later, back at college, we begin to turn.
	- My eyesight begins to worsen, and I get glasses that match the handsome and stylish Dr. Acula.
	- I find out that an Aura of Darkness surrounds me, and people come to know me as "Dusker."

## Prompts

### 1.7.1

_Your body manifests some trait related to the vampire that created you. How do you become more like them? Create a Skill that reflects this._

I guess the worst year in the world isn't the only 2020 in the rear view. I'd been having trouble reading my sheet music all week, so I went to an optometrist (a 24 hour optometrist (bless you, NY) called "Dr. Seegood;" not kidding). Neither of our parents or grandparents needed glasses, and it happened so suddenly. But I need to start wearing glasses. I picked some up that our mom's insurance will cover. Here's the thing though. You're going to laugh at me, and you should. I couldn't think of any Jazz musicians that wore glasses, so I was lost on what style of glasses I should get when I realized who looked good in glasses: Dr. Acula.

### 2.3.1

_A loved one discovers your condition and works to help you. Create a Resource which represents their assistance. Create a mortal character if none are available._

So Elle knows now. I was going to tell her, but she found out before I could. Luckily she believes me that I was going to tell her. It was just... hard. But she actually helped me. I guess one of her friends was doing an art project that required a lot of human blood. (I think given our condition she may want to rethink the term "required".) But anyway, she ended up emailing her and asking where she got it from. It turns out there's a lot of websites selling it. I think it might be for hospitals, but as long as you had a note from your school, the websites didn't mind making some extra cash. Luckily, Elle's friend owed her a favor because she let us use her account with the website. It's not cheap, but it helps. Elle really came through for me. Again.

### 3.5.1

_You murder someone you love or respect rather than let them expose you. Kill a character. Check a skill. If you have no living Characters, kill no one and create a beloved mortal Character who you have betrayed._

I

I didn't mean to kill him.

Intention still has to count for something, right? Emil, the senior who had me play in his combo at the start of the year, invited me play two songs with the combo in trade for helping them set up and tear down. I should have refused, but I couldn't resist. It was late at night, and at The Smoke which never cards. It would have been perfect if there wasn't a delay on all packages sent through the school (they're freaking out about the "addictive nature" of the vaccine here too). I hadn't fed in three days when I saw the rat scamper from behind the back wheel of the car as I loaded some mic stands into the van. Before I even knew what was going on I had leapt on it and began sucking it dry. I didn't even have time to see Emil smoking a cigarette behind the van. His face was pale. He looked scared. I imagine myself as his twin except instead of a lit cigarette in my hand, there was a dying, convulsing rat. When the cigarette hit the ground, he was already running for the club. When the bloody rat hit the ground, I was at his neck. I moved his body further into the alley and took his wallet before I went back to the club. Believably shaken when I told them I found his body.

Intention still has to count for something.

### 4.7.2

_People see a horror in you that you cannot perceive in yourself. What Mark do you possess that you do not know about? Create a Mark and a suspicious mortal who has seen it. What name do the people call you when your back is turned?_

Hey, it's been a while. And mom and dad said you'd never be an airship pirate! I wonder who'd be more pissed if they found out? (Definitely mom.) You know what? I never tried going outside in direct sunlight. I was too afraid! But it hasn't been a problem anymore, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Sorry for the delayed response. You'd think you wouldn't really have to study as an immortal music school student, but it turns out practice doesn't care about how much time you have ahead of you. The practice rooms are good to be in around dawn and dusk, and even better to be in if your school lets you use them "only during the day" over the summer. My nights have been busy. I've been playing piano anywhere that will have me. I've been subbing in as many combos and bands that will have me (and two that wouldn't), but most of my nights have been playing for tips at The Uptown Dusk.

Which leads me to my second big update. I'd been noticing some weird... quirks? Of people around me. People having to turn on their music stand lights in total light. Teachers turning up the brightness on their projectors despite it looking fine. Most annoyingly, the eyeD scanners no longer pick me up at all, so I have to scan my thumb almost everywhere I go. Elle was finally the one who brought it up to me. She said that it could be noon on the hottest, brightest day of the year, but the closer she gets to me the closer to midnight on a moonless night it seemed.

I guess that's why Abe, the waiter who gives me weird, dirty looks, has been giving me weird, dirty looks. It also explains why some people (even those who had no idea I played at The Uptown Dusk) have started calling me "Dusker."

### 5.12.1

_New laws or social mores make it harder for you to hide among the populace. How are you nearly caught and destroyed? Check a Skill. Create a Skill. Create a mortal criminal who assists you._

Well. I guess I got arrested, and I can't believe I was first. Someone somewhere owes someone else money because of this; I'm sure of it.

NYPD has really been cracking down on eyeD requirements. I guess the whole world is, but it wasn't a whole world officer that smashed my glasses and told me to get a doctors note if eyeD "really doesn't work" on me (yes, he did the air quotes). Well on my way back to a practice room, I got picked up and put in a squad for "property damage to to NYC iris scanners and 3D cameras." I'm sure they knew as well as I did that the cameras were fine now; or at least as good as any Amazon Holo-Ring is out of the box (not very). They were picking me up to harass me and / or to look busy.

But as they gave me shit safe behind the nearly invisible barrier, their airbags exploded into their faces. The car swerving into a barrier. I only heard the car alarm after it went silent. The doors swung up and away from the car on their own, and a friendly face waved at me. Albeit, a friendly face wearing plastic diffuser goggles that obscured his eyes in a way that almost looked like digital noise.

I thought when Acid Ed said "help me unlock the secret to how you block the iris scanners," he meant "chill out with some electrodes hooked up to you and munch out, or play some songs" and specifically did not mean "help me actually program the sensors and the eventual glasses." So this semester hasn't been my favorite so far. Though I guess I have infinite tries?

I guess the field test for these will have to be your funeral... Should I go?

P.S. I ate the cops.
