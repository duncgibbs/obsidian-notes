"Eveningbough more like Demonbough." Good one, Chris.

Liotique made a sweet summoning speech.

Erdo wants to be the center of Ezekiel's attention.

Liotique summoned the demon Surgat, who smells like brimstone and cheap perfume. It left a burn around her finger, spelling out an everchanging name.

Erdo witnesses Prince Ezekiel stand and whisper into Cardinal Lory's ear. He smelled brimstone and cheap perfume while it was happening.

Crake believed a break in ocurred at Liotique's workshop and used it as an excuse to steal a minor book on demonology.

Genevieve of Somnifer is Astrid's stepmother.

Liotique attempts to discover more about the sealed book, but is only able to establish its connection to the sea with the research material she has in her workshop.

Anguille sigil is an eel wrapped around a tower.

Sir Lambert arrives malnourished. He informs the royal court that the armada was attacked by Karzia the Weather Witch, and the king's ship was struck by lightning and sunk. The Queen orders everyone not to speak of this.

Erdo overhears the Queen refuse to crown the Prince in hopes of still finding her husband. Cardinal Lory is silent on the issue. Erdo reports this to Gille.

At the house of Kookalicot, Crake, Finnan, and Astrid find Silas, an injured servant, and Genevieve guarding a locked room from which screaming and smashing erupt.

Silas died because Crake sucks.

Finnan and Crake were unable to get any information out of the Ogrin demon/angel.
