Liotique invites Erdo and Finnan to come with her to the Eveningbough University library in order to do research on her mysterious book.

Stopped at the door, Liotique reveals she is a graduate of the university. While doing her research, Liotique also reads the letters that Finnan took from the Orsey house. It details why Jacque left the house for Sarville, mentioning that Liotique and Zamara failed to cure Ira resulting in an uninhabitable home, as well as the city and the noble houses - notably House Tarpin - becoming more dangerous.

Liotique continues her research while Finnan tries to search for - and steal - a book about the Forest People. When he is caught, Erdo attempts to convince Liotique that the book is rightfully Finnan's. The two sides cannot come to an agreement and Finnan attempts to take off running with the book. When Erdo is apprehended however, Finnan sacrifices keeping the book in order to rescue him.

Meanwhile, at the House Anguille Crake plays a Vincal game with Terry Laguard, the Guard. He is interrupted by Reng and taken to see Brairie.

Crake is payed handsomely for bringing the two books, and he informs Brairie that the Patriarch will be in town in a week. Brairie has Crake taken to wait in another room while Erdo brings Brairie the letter from The Director.

Afterwards, Crake is tasked by Brairie to kill Erdo.
