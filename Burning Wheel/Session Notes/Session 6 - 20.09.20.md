The plan for Crake is to:

1. Find info about Lory
2. Explore Monastery
3. Find info about Erdo (for blackmail)
4. Await Erdo

I will disguise myself as a lay servant.

“I’m here about… the smell."

I want to steal Liotique’s spooky book.

Ogrin is demon?!

Should I kidnap the Prince and raise him? Food for thought.
